# AnsPi
**Ans**wer **Pi**cker is a simple app made for teachers in schools who would like to pick a student for answer, whilst guaranteeing equal chances for everyone - without any biases. Along with, the basic adding/editing class and rolling students for answers functionality, this app also provides common students' benefits like lucky number, or not being able to be questioned for a few rolls after answering.
